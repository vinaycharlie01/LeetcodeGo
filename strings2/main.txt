Sure, here are the corresponding command-line commands for each of the flags listed in the output of go test --help:

-bench pattern: To run benchmarks that match a specific pattern.
Command: go test -bench=<pattern>

-benchmem: To include memory allocation statistics in benchmark results.
Command: go test -benchmem

-benchtime d: To run each benchmark for a specific duration.
Command: go test -benchtime=<duration>

-cover: To enable coverage analysis.
Command: go test -cover

-covermode set: To set the mode for coverage analysis.
Command: go test -covermode=set

-coverpkg pattern: To apply coverage analysis separately to packages matching a regexp pattern.
Command: go test -coverpkg=<pattern>

-cpuprofile file: To write a CPU profile to a file.
Command: go test -cpuprofile=<file>

-count n: To run tests and benchmarks n times.
Command: go test -count=<n>

-failfast: To not start new tests after the first test failure.
Command: go test -failfast

-json: To produce machine-readable JSON output for tests.
Command: go test -json

-list pattern: To list tests, benchmarks, or examples matching a regexp pattern then exit.
Command: go test -list=<pattern>

-memprofile file: To write a memory profile to a file.
Command: go test -memprofile=<file>

-mutexprofile string: To write a mutex profile to a file.
Command: go test -mutexprofile=<file>

-parallel n: To run at most n tests in parallel.
Command: go test -parallel=<n>

-run pattern: To run only tests and examples matching a regexp pattern.
Command: go test -run=<pattern>

-short: To run a smaller test suite to save time.
Command: go test -short

-timeout d: To panic the test binary after a specified duration (timeout).
Command: go test -timeout=<duration>

-trace file: To write an execution trace to a file.
Command: go test -trace=<file>

You can use these commands along with the go test command to achieve specific testing and benchmarking configurations as described by each flag.
